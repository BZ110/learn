# Example use (Learn)
You can see I had 6 example images of hotdogs, after converting them to an array, I then trained them to 1 array. After training was done, I simply brought up a photo of a hotdog that was not trained.

## How do I know if it was a hotdog or not?
Value 0.5 or above usually indicates that it has similarity
Value 0.499 or below usually indicates that it has low similarity.

You can see I got the value of 0.7, which means the photo I showed to my code (Learn) deemed it to be a hotdog.
