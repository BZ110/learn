# Learn
I was bored.

## What is it?
Basically, you can merge multiple arrays into one. Using that merged array, you can compare it to inputs that might be similar to the input that you have.

## How do you use it?
Index.js not only has the code but also the explanation of everything.

## What is data.json, how do I make one myself?
Basically, it's 2 circles. You need at least 2 inputs, and they need to be the same length.
All that my trained data does is detect if a 10x10 black-and-white grid is a circle. That's it.

## Can't I just make multiple of these Learn classes and merge them together?
Yes, if you put enough data in all of them, and merge them together properly, you'd be able to have multiple guesses with multiple answers. You can make each Learn class dependent on other Learn classes and more.
